<h1 align="center">Welcome to Niklaus' Portfolio</h1>
<p align="center"><i>An Introduction of myself<br>
Hey there! I'm Niklaus Liu, and I've recently graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University with a major in Economics and Accounting. My journey so far has led me through some amazing accounting internships, but now, I've set my sights on a financial analyst role. That's why I've put together this repository to showcase my diverse range of skills and projects that go beyond accounting.<br>
<br>
Feel free to explore my work, and if you happen to know of any job openings that align with my aspirations, I'm all ears! But it's not just about the job hunt; I'm always up for a friendly chat over a cup of coffee ‚òï and eager to discuss a wide range of topics. So, whether it's career opportunities or just a good conversation, I'm here and excited to connect with you!
