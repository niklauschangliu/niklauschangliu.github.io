							<p>Wisabi Bank, a prominent financial institution in Nigeria, has embarked on a pivotal data analytics initiative to delve into its ATM transactions data. With a vast network spanning from Lagos to FCT Abuja, the bank offers an array of financial services, from savings accounts to investments. In a bid to elevate customer experience and streamline operations, I have been commissioned as an external consultant. The project's core objective is to address multifaceted business queries, ranging from average transaction amounts by location to ATM utilization rates. By harnessing the data from various tables like Transactions, Location, and Customers Dimension, the analysis will encompass data cleansing, transformation, and visualization through tools like Excel and Power BI. The culmination of this endeavor will be a suite of interactive reports and dashboards, designed to empower Wisabi Bank with actionable insights, fostering data-driven decision-making and operational excellence.</p>
							<p>In this report, I designed and implemented an intricate ATM transaction report using Power BI, analyzing over 2 million individual transaction records spanning a year. This project entailed the adept utilization of Power BI's advanced features, including data modeling, DAX formulas, and custom visuals. By integrating real-time data, I showcased my proficiency in creating interactive dashboards that offer valuable insights into ATM transaction patterns based on date and locations. My analysis also identified customer behaviors, such as a 20% higher transaction rate among individuals aged 25-35, and highlighted potential areas of improvement, like certain ATMs with a 30% longer average transaction time in some states; transactions occur most in the afternoon especially around 6 p.m. This experience underscores my expertise in data visualization, analytics, and the ability to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence. Those insights are important in leading to improvement in ATM operational efficiency.</p>
