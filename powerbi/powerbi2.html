							<p>Nasdaq, short for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, is one of the preeminent stock exchanges in the United States. Established in 1971 as the world's inaugural electronic stock market, Nasdaq has grown into a leading platform for buying and selling various financial securities, particularly stocks. Its distinctiveness lies in its electronic trading system, which has transformed the trading landscape, making it faster and more efficient. Nasdaq's reputation is also rooted in its profound connection with technology and innovation. It hosts an array of tech giants, biotechnology firms, and other notable companies.</p>
							<p>In this report, I utilized <strong>Python</strong> to retrieve the daily closing prices of over <strong>2,000 stocks</strong> from Yahoo Finance over the past five years. I cleaned and organized the acquired data, importing it into Power BI and establishing relationships with other datasets. Additionally, I was responsible for <strong>summarizing and addressing</strong> the overall research question, delivering a presentation through the creation of relevant visualizations. Furthermore, in this presentation, I collaborated with my peers in employing Alteryx, a machine learning software, to conduct data analysis. Lastly, through a comprehensive <strong>study and analysis of historical stock data</strong>, I elucidated the reasons behind why the stock with the ticker symbol 'ENPH' exhibited a remarkable yield of 7,237%, surpassing the returns of other Nasdaq-listed stocks.</p>
